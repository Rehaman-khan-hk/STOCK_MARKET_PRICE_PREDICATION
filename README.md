Stock Market Crash Prediction
This project focuses on predicting potential stock market crashes using historical stock data and machine learning techniques. The model is developed in Python using popular data science libraries and is trained to identify patterns indicative of a financial downturn.

🧠 Project Objective
To analyze historical stock market data and predict possible crash scenarios using machine learning.

To build a predictive model that assists investors and analysts in identifying early warning signs of market crashes.
